# Graphics

- ~~vga driver~~ DONE
  - ~~takes in a 25.125 MHz clock (using PLL), outputs hsync, hsync, row, col, and valid~~ 

- color decoder
- takes a 3-bit input value, returns a specific color in the form of 6-bit RGB (see rgb_colors_6bit to see the 6-bit code corresponding to a certain color)
- this is really just a multiplexer. It can be implemented all with combinational logic when statements.
